			<p>
			I'm a free-range content, concept and experience creator. Learning new things and turning that knowledge into action (sometimes) is how I like to make my living. That's taken various forms over the years: I've taught English in Chile, translated gallery documents in France, and picked apples in New Zealand, amongst other pursuits. 
			</p>
			<p>
			More relevantly I was the senior communications manager at Couchsurfing.com from 2009 to 2013. During that time I helped our membership grow from 800k to over 5 million (and sent newsletters and expertly crafted error messages to them all). Following that, I freelanced for several years for organizations ranging from a Quaker burial ground to Marsh Mclennan. Those projects included building Wordpress sites, copy-editing business documents, and creating original content. My next adventure was locating experts to speak at extremely fancy, private corporate events. And ultimately, I decided it was time to return to my internet roots (holla, Geocities!) and learn how to code.

			When I'm not pursuing my meandering path towards my dreams, I enjoy camping, bicycling, reading, barbecues, and hanging out with my gremlin puppy.
